- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SlowCoder7
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in information technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, Java Script, CSS, Python, and data managnement.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, you can't yet. I'm shy.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The feeling online in the early 2000's was magical, however a bit unsafe for a young person.
